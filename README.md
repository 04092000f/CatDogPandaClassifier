# Implement a CNN-Based Image Classifier

In this project, we have implemented a <code>3-class</code> <b>Image Classifier</b>, using a <b>CNN</b>, on a dataset, which consists of <code>1000</code> images each of <b>panda, cat and dog</b<. We took the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ashishsaxena2209/animal-image-datasetdog-cat-and-panda">Kaggle</a>, and split it into <code>80:20</code> ratio for <code>train:validation</code>.

## This Project had Two-folded Purpose:
<ul>
<li>Building and training a neural network from scratch in order to understand how to build and train a real network on real data. everything had been implemented this time - right from getting the data to analysing the final results.</li>
<li>Reinforce the use of the complete training pipeline</li>
</ul>
